# Learning Cryptography and Ethereum with Alchemy University

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in **cryptography** and **Ethereum development** through the [Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum).

## What I'm Learning

- **Fundamentals of Cryptography**
- **Smart Contracts using Solidity**
- **Ethereum Blockchain Architecture**
- **DApp Development**
- **Security Best Practices**

This hands-on program is equipping me with the skills needed to build secure and scalable decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum.
