# Learning Cryptography and Ethereum with Alchemy University

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in **Cryptography** and **Ethereum development** through [Alchemy University's Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum). This course dives deep into:

- Fundamentals of Cryptography
- Smart Contracts using Solidity
- Ethereum Blockchain Architecture
- DApp Development
- Security Best Practices

This hands-on program is equipping me with the skills needed to build secure and scalable decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum.
